# Machine-Learning-Beginner-to-Advance

Welcome to my Machine Learning Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning machine learning and contains my progress updates on a weekly basis.

## Week 1

In the first week, I focused on getting started with the basics of Python. Here are the key highlights of what I have accomplished:

- Variables in Python
- Strings in Python.
- Conditional Statements(If statement, if-else statement and if-elif-else statemtns in Python.
- Loops(While loop and for loops)
- Functions in Python(Buildin and User-define functions)

To access the code for Week 1, please navigate to the "Week 1" folder in this repository.

## Week 2

During the second week, I covered more Python concepts/

- Dictionaries
- Lists
- List Comprehensions
- Sets
- Tuples

To access the code for Week 2, please navigate to the "Week 2" folder in this repository.

## Future Updates

I will continue to update this repository on a weekly basis as I progress in my machine learning journey.
